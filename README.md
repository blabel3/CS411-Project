Ideas
# Spotify Album Cover Generator
Description (one paragraph):
	
Create an album cover that matches the playlist given the moods of the songs. Use information such as lyric key words, key, bpm, and song titles to determine shapes and colors ect of an image and use an image API to combine images and/or generate a new image.

Database:
	Some user preferences and the images that it generated for the user.
	Graphics used to generate images.

Data sets (at least two):
Spotify Data Catalogue (Spotify Web API)
Some Image API? (Unsplash) (Google open images) (Artbreeder)

Third-Party Authentication:
Spotify, Google, or Facebook or whatever for logins 

Remember to implement using decoupled architecture!

# Food/Cooking idea
Description:
Users input ingredients they have available and their dietary restrictions/goals and get a generated selection of recipes along with shopping lists for each one. The app also provides information about where the products from the shopping list can be found (at the best price nearby)
Maybe returned recipes can be sorted in different aspects? Like sorting by calories, type of protein in it. Is it more meat based or more vegetable based. 
The application also tracks calories to help the user achieve calorie goals. 

Database:
	Store usersâ€™ dietary restrictions/goal macronutrients & calorie goals

Datasets:
	Food & Recipe API (Spoonacular)
	Instacart API for shopping cart/delivery options?

Third-Party Authentication:
	Google/Facebook/etc for logging in

Remember to implement using architecture from class!
