# CS411-Project 

## Spotify Album Cover Generator

Website that lets people generate unique album covers for their spotify playlists. Currently spotify's automatic playlist covers are just some of the album arts stitched together, and the creator has to go and make an image themself if they want something memorable for it. Our app would make an album cover that fits the playlist given the moods of the songs automatically. It will use infortmation from the Spotify API like the lyric keywords, key, bpm, dancability, and song titles to determine images, shapes and colors to use. It will also use image APIs like Unsplash or Artbreeder to find cool images to include in the playlist cover.
