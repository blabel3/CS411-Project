# To run prototype:

* Copy contents of this folder to a folder called dist/ in the root of the project

* Have our .env file in your directory with the key needed to access the API

* Run `npm install`

* Run `npm start` (Note we're not building, since the files are already in dist/!)

Then you can go to your-local-server-url/prototype to ssee it in action!
