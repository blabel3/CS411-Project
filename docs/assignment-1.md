## Spotify Album Cover Generator

Website that lets people generate unique album covers for their spotify playlists. Currently spotify's automatic playlist covers are just some of the album arts stitched together, and the creator has to go and make an image themself if they want something memorable for it. Our app would make an album cover that fits the playlist given the moods of the songs automatically. It will use infortmation from the Spotify API like the lyric keywords, key, bpm, dancability, and song titles to determine images, shapes and colors to use. It will also use image APIs like Unsplash or Artbreeder to find cool images to include in the playlist cover. 

## Recipe Helper Idea

This would be an app where users can log in, and input their calorie and macronutrient goals and any dietary restrictions, plus any food that they already have, and it will generate some recipes to help them meet that goal, and shopping lists for them to get any ingredients they need. It also provides information about where the products can be found, or lets users click to order using a delivery service like Instacart. When it's time to cook, they cna see the step by step instructions and even have the site set timers for them. They can plan out meals for the day or weeek, or just get it to suggest something when they're out of ideas.
