# “As a user, I want to use a generated image as the cover for my playlist”

*User Story 3*

1. User needs to be logged in (see [User Story 1](1-I-want-to-log-in.md))
2. User needs to have generated an image (see [User Story 2](2-I-want-to-generate-an-image.md))
3. If the playlist is their own, user can click a button to set that image as the cover for that playlist
  * If not, this button will be greyed out/disabled. 
4. It will show a check mark when the image has been set as the playlist cover. 
5. The user will also be able to save the image to their gallery by clicking a save button.
  * If they are not logged in, this button is greyed out/disabled.
6. User will also have the option to download the image to their computer with a download button (can download even if not logged in)
  * “I want to share my generated image to other places so that I can flex my cool playlist fashion.”
    1. They can click on social media buttons to make a post about their new image easily.
    2. The user can choose to share through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram
    3. A post is prepared “Check out my cool computer Generated playlist cover!! {link-to-our-website-here}” with the image attached.
  * “No image was generated or the image was blank”
    1. If there is a problem in accessing enough information to generate the image, a descriptive error message will be displayed.
    2. If there is enough information, but the algorithm is creating a blank, then the user can either refresh the page or click on “Generate Image” again. If no change occurs, this is all they will get for that playlist.
