# “As a user, I want to log in so I can easily access my playlists”

*User Story 1*


1. User goes to website homepage and clicks “Sign In to Spotify”
2. User logs into their existing Spotify account
  * “I don’t have a Spotify account”
    * They can click on “create account” and will be redirected to the Spotify create an account page
  * “I forgot my password”
    * The user clicks on Spotify’s “I forgot my password” link, and they are instructed to enter their email address connected to the account in order to continue the reset-password process.
  * “I forgot my username”
    * User simply logs in with their email address connected to their account
  * “I forgot my email address”
    * The user needs to create a new account through spotify.
  * “I don’t want to log in. I just want to use a spotify link.”
    * The user pastes their playlist link into the “Paste link” textbox on the homepage. This will allow them to skip the login process and instead of searching their own playlists, they can paste a link into the website and get an image generated in that way (see [User Story 2](2-I-want-to-generate-an-image.md)).
    * This however means they will not be able to save an image to view them later in the gallery (see [User Story 4](4-I-want-to-see-images-I-have-generated.md)).
